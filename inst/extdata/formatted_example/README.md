# Formatted Example Data

This folder provides a real-data formatted example for MR-MOSS:

- Exposure: `Smoking_initiation`
- Outcomes: `AMD`, `AMD_dry`, `AMD_wet`

Each file is tab-delimited and follows MR-MOSS formatted-input requirements:
`SNP`, `A1`, `A2`, `Z`, `N`, `chi2`, `P`.

These files are included for end-to-end demonstration of
`formatted data -> MR-MOSS result`.
